# zhovtobruhd/numerical-methods

This repository is a result of completing Numerical Methods course at Simon Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics

There are some notebooks that will help you to understand basics of numerical methods, such as approximation, interpolation and solving linear equations.  

The code in this repo demonstrates how basic algorithms work, however, it is highly recommended to use scikit-learn Python module due to its higher reliability (some examples of using the module you can find in the repo).
